A demo for Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128 released in March 2023 at Forever demo party in Slovakia.

This repository contains the source code of the demo including the tools necessary to build it
(Windows only). The work comes with **no license** which means that I am retaining the rights,
including the rights to modify and distribute the code. However, I understand the demo scene
as a feedback loop where the community not only invents new ideas but also builds upon existing
ones. Whoever cares enough to look at this repository can use a disassembler anyway. Therefore,
if it helps anyone create a better demo, mission accomplished.

The code is commented quite extensively and even though there are some unpolished parts I think
itâ€™s in decent shape. 2023 was a good year in terms of ZX Spectrum releases so let's roll on.
